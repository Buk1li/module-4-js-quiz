## General Info
This is a simple quiz app to test Javascript knowledge. The score is factored using how long it takes to complete the quiz, detracting time when answers are incorrect. Users can then enter in their initials and be entered into a list of highscores that are stored in local storage.

Overall this was a really fun challenge, it definitely used a lot of methods I was unfamiliar with, and would like to get better at over time. Im glad to have learned a lot from this application.
